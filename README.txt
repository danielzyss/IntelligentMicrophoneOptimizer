The Intelligent Microphone: 

Computer Program for the Bachelor of Engineering Physics at the university of Bristol (DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS). 

To run the program run main.py, all parameters can be tuned from the annotated file parameters.py. 

This project contains code in Python 3.5 and in C++ compiled with Clang on MacOS. 

NOTE: The data folder is missing as it contains more than the allowed 100Mb of data. The Data comes from https://homepages.wmich.edu/~hillenbr/voweldata.html and can be formatted with DatasetOrganization.py. 

Thank you for your interest,
